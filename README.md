PyChat
PyChat is a simple chat application built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MongoDB for storing messages. It allows users to send and receive messages in real-time. The application continuously fetches the most recent messages from the MongoDB database and displays them in the GUI.

Features
Send Messages: Users can type a message and send it to the chat.
Real-time Fetching: Messages are fetched from the MongoDB database every 2 seconds and displayed in the chat window.
MongoDB Integration: All messages are stored in a MongoDB collection for persistent storage.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
pymongo: MongoDB driver for Python
MongoDB: MongoDB server running locally or remotely
Installation
Install MongoDB:

Follow the instructions to install MongoDB on your machine.
Start the MongoDB server by running:
    mongod

Install Required Python Libraries: Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
    pip install pymongo

Run the Application: After ensuring that MongoDB is running, you can run the application:
    python pyChat.py

Using the Chat:

Open the application window.
Type a message in the entry field and click the "Send" button to send the message.
The chat will automatically update every 2 seconds with the latest messages stored in the MongoDB database.
Code Overview
MongoDB Connection: The application connects to a local MongoDB instance using pymongo.MongoClient and interacts with a database named PyChat and a collection called messages.

Tkinter GUI: The GUI consists of an entry widget for typing messages, a button to send the message, and a label to display the fetched messages.

Message Sending: When a user types a message and presses the "Send" button, the message is inserted into the MongoDB collection, and the message list is updated.

Message Fetching: Every 2 seconds, the fetch_messages() function fetches the latest messages from the MongoDB collection and updates the label displaying the messages.

MongoDB Schema
The application uses a simple schema to store messages. Each message is stored as a document with the following structure:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "text": "Message text"
}
Troubleshooting
MongoDB Not Running: Make sure your MongoDB server is running before launching the application. If the server is not running, you will encounter a connection error.
Tkinter Installation Issues: If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using your system's package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install python3-tk on Ubuntu).
MongoDB Connection Issues: Ensure that the MongoDB URI "mongodb://localhost:27017/" is correct. If you're using a remote MongoDB server, replace the URI with the correct one.

Future Improvements
Implement user authentication for chat users.
Add message timestamps to display when a message was sent.
Allow message deletion and editing.
Enhance the user interface with more features like colors, formatting, etc.
